"""
Chatbot using natural language processing in neural networks in Python.
Need to set up a so called "intense.json file"; this file contains certain categories of
things that can happen e.g. the user greeting the chatbot.
The chatbot can adapt to data. e.g., as the user continues to greet the bot, it'll
begin to adapt to those phrases.
Ultimately training the bot to recognize what the user is trying to get from it and
then the chatbot is going to have some static responses to the users questions/requests
